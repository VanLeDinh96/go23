# Product Management with Golang and Gin-Gonic

![Golang Logo](https://golang.org/doc/gopher/frontpage.png)

This repository demonstrates a simple implementation of Product Management API using Golang and Gin-Gonic framework. The API allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products, with support for authentication using BasicAuth and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

## Features

- Create a new product by providing product details as JSON input.
- Update an existing product's details using a JSON input.
- Delete a product by its ID.
- Retrieve a list of all products.
- Basic Authentication to protect certain endpoints.
- JWT Authentication for secure access to protected endpoints.

## Installation and Usage

Follow the steps below to set up and run the Product Management API on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Go (Golang) installed on your system.
- Git installed on your system.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Configuration

Edit the configuration files `development.yaml` and `production.yaml` in the `configs` directory to set your desired database credentials and JWT secret.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
go mod download
```

### Step 4: Run the API

```bash
go run cmd/main.go
```

The API will run on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

## File Structure

The project follows a modular and organized file structure to improve maintainability and scalability.
